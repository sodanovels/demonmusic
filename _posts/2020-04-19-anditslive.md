## You Can't Quarantine the Past
This had to reboot somewhere, sometime, turns out it's in the midst of some self-isolating weirdness that some of us, or one of us, saw coming! Reality is certainly more different than it's ever been, but music, not so much! It's soulful and always will be.

## Sharing in the time of COVID
I think it's fair to say our sharing of music has always been an immutable heartbeat in our connected lives and we shared so much of it as mixtapeas back in the day--time to reboot that feeling of sharing with the current tools we have and the times we're in. Enjoy this throwback set of songs that can make for an easy Sunday morning, a groovy *illegal* drive in the countryside, or any and all pud-like shenanigans! 

***Lot's of love, in 4/4 time.***
