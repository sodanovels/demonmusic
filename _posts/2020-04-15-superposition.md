## an asp to know
I was lost in a lake and the shapes that your body makes. And the mountains said I will find you here-they whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear. I traced my finger along your trails and your body was the map, and... I was lost in it.

why you get and cables and that... play. it'll pry the how-don't marry to it, it is something to ward off with others within it. Revisit, let your spirit rise, and you become unto the seemingly ease--its not about what you do, woher you probably know the why you want to corfe, aspen up to yourself and you'll fall. Don't get caught up in fitting the moulds, get mouldy, grow your way out of it.
