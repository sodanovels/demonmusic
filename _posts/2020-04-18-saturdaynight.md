##Sharing in the time of COVID
This started somewhere, turns out it's in the midst of some weirdness that some of us, or one of us, saw coming, but reality is different than it has been, but music, not so much--it's the back beat to our lives and we shared so much of it as mixtapeas back in the day, time to reboot that with the tools we have and the times we're in. Enjoy this throwback set of tunes that can make for an easy Sunday morning, or anytime I suppose. Lot's of love, in 4/4 time!
